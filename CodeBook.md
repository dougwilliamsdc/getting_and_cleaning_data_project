###Introduction  
Variable names have been kept consistent with the names from the Human Activity   
Recognition Using Smartphones data set, but have been prefixed with "average_"   
to indicate that measurement is a mean of all measurements from a given subject_number  
 and activity.  Units are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]  

Please reference features_info.txt in the original dataset for more detail on each variable.
